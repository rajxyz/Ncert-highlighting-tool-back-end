      Born on 5 July 1904, in Kempten, Germany,
      <span class="highlight">Ernst Mayr</span>, the Harvard University evolutionary biologist
      who has been called <em>‘The Darwin of the 20<sup>th</sup> century’</em>, was one of the 100 greatest
      scientists of all time. Mayr joined Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1953 and
      retired in 1975, assuming the title <em>Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology Emeritus</em>.
      Throughout his nearly 80-year career, his research spanned ornithology, taxonomy,
      zoogeography, evolution, systematics, and the history and philosophy of biology.
      He almost single-handedly made the origin of species diversity the central question
      of evolutionary biology that it is today.

    <p>
      He also pioneered the currently accepted definition of a biological species.
      Mayr was awarded the three prizes widely regarded as the <em>triple crown of biology</em>:
      the <em>Balzan Prize</em> in 1983, the <em>International Prize for Biology</em> in 1994, and
      the <em>Crafoord Prize</em> in 1999. Mayr died at the age of 100 in the year 2004.
