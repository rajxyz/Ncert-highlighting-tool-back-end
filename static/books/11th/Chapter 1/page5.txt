Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the world.
This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature or naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identification.
In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established procedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism. This is acceptable to biologists all over the world.
For plants, scientific names are based on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN).
You may ask, how are animals named? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN).
The scientific names ensure that each organism has only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people (in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name.
They also ensure that such a name has not been used for any other known organism.
