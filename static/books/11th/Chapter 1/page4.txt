1.1 Diversity in the Living World (continued)
If you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it potted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants.
There are also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but they are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make observations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would increase.
Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably see a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it.
Each different kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a species.
The number of species that are known and described range between 1.7â€“1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity, or the number and types of organisms present on Earth.
We should remember here that as we explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously being identified.
As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world; we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names. These local names would vary from place to place, even within a country.
Probably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we did not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms we are talking about.
