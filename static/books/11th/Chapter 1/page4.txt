  types of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as we explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously being identified.

  As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world; we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names. These local names would vary from place to place, even within a country. Probably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we did not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms we are talking about.

  Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the world. This process is called <span class="highlight">nomenclature</span>. Obviously, nomenclature or naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we know to what organism the name is attached to. This is <span class="highlight">identification</span>.

  In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established procedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism. This is acceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names are based on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how are animals named? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organism has only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people (in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure that such a name has not been used for any other known organism.

  Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific names to known organisms. Each name has two components â€“ the <span class="highlight">Generic name</span> and the <span class="highlight">specific epithet</span>. This system of providing a name with two components is called <span class="highlight">Binomial nomenclature</span>. This naming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists all over the world. This naming system using a two word format was found convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the way of providing scientific names better. The scientific name of mango is written as <span class="italic">Mangifera indica</span>. Let us see how it is a binomial name. In this name <span class="italic">Mangifera</span> represents the genus while <span class="italic">indica</span>, is a particular species, or a specific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows:

<div class="para">
  <ol>
    <li>Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics. They are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their origin.</li>
    <li>The first word in a biological name represents the genus while the second component denotes the specific epithet.</li>
    <li>Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are separately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin origin.</li>
  </ol>
